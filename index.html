        I am currently living in Round Hill, Virginia and working as an instructional technologist at Johns Hopkins University
        School of Advanced International Studies. Prior to this job, I spent the previous eight years living and working in Southeast Asia.
        I lived in Phnom Penh for about 5 years, Cebu, Philippines for about 2 years and Nonthaburi, Thailand for a little less than a year. I held various roles in education while living and
        working abroad. 
      </p>

      <p> I am currently completing a Master of Science in Computer Information Systems at Boston University, with a concentration in Web Application Development. In 2020, I completed a Master of 
        Educational Technology at Boise State University. I also recieved a School Technology Coordinator Graduate Certificate. I am passionate about education and I love technology. I am 
        especially interested in using technology to improve learning outcomes. 
      </p>

        I met my partner, Meizel, in 2013 when I moved to Phnom Penh. She had recently moved to Cambodia from the Philippines. We have two children, David and Jean. David is seven years old and loves
        swimming and video games. Jean is about one and a half years old and loves swimming. We love to travel as a family, although we haven't been able to much for the past year and a half. My mother got sick
        so I had to move back to the US to help her. I applied for Meizel's US visa in August 2021, but we are still waiting. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Our family loves to go to the beach and spend as much time as we can in the water. We have travelled to several different beaches in Cambodia, Philippines and Thailand. Of all the places that we have visited
        El Nido, Philippines is my favorite (see picture of Meizel and I on a kayak). The limestone rock formations emerging from the torquoise water is breathtaking. Hua Hin, Thailand is another beach where we spent some time
        and absolutely loved the town. I am looking forward to travelling around the US with my family, when they are able to join me in the States.
