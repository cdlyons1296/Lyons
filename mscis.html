   <p>I am currently completing a Master of Science in Computer Information Systems, with a concentration in Web Application Development. I am expecting to graduate in 
    August 2023. After completing my Master of Educational Technology program, I decided I wanted to enhance my technical knowledge and learn about programming and advanced topics in 
    information technology. I was living in Cambodia at the time so I needed to find an online program that would accept people with a limited technical background. I found this program 
    at Boston University and applied. I was exstatic to recieve conditional admission. I just needed to successfully complete Introduction to Computer Information Systems.  
    This course taught me the basic concepts of information systems and introduced me to programmin with Java. After my successful completion of the course, I was fully admitted into the BU MSCIS program.   
</p>
<p> 
In CS 546 I learned primary concepts of statistics and probability. This course provided knowledge of the mathematical concepts necessary to be successful in the program. In CS 520 I learned about
information structures, and gained more experience programming with Java. In CS 625, I gained a deeper undertanding of the fundamental of networking as well a the different technologies and methods used to 
transfer data. In CS 669 I designed and built a database to store course infomation related to the online program I support at work. I gained a deeper knowledge of designing and building a database using a relational
database management system and improved my SQL programming skills. I learned about planning, and developing an application in CS 682. I created classe diagrams, data flow chart, sequence diagrams, and activity diagrams in 
developing the application.</p>
<p>
    I am currently completing CS 601, where I am imporving my HTML and CSS skills, and gaining a sold foundation in building applications with Javascript. This is the first course in my concentration,
    and I am looking forward to learnin more about building applications in future courses. I chose this concentration because I would like to build educational applications in the future. 
</p>
<p>
    I have already learned a lot since I started this program. I am looking forward to continue to learn over the next 8 months as I complete my degree. I hope to use the skills that I gain in this program 
    to secure a more technical job in education, where I am designing applications for learning.
