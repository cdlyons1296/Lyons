    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am passionate about both education and technology. I am especially interested in using technology to improve learning outcomes and access to education world-wide. 
        I currently work as an instructional technologist as Johns Hopkins Universtiy School of Advanced International Studies. In my role at SAIS, I train faculty, staff and students
    on the Canvas learning management system, as well as any other technology tools that are used in the schools' online learning environments. I provide technical support for all of the 
 educational tools in the school and create technical documentation for these tools. I support instructors in their creation and modification of courses in the online learning system. I also hire and manage the 
student assitant workers who aid in our course support duties.</p>
<p>Before joining SAIS, I was the English Program Coorinator/Distance Learning Coordinator at a primary school in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. I started working there in November of 2019. I had previously worked at the school
    from 2013 to 2015 as an English teacher. I was brought on to manage the teachers in the English program and improve the curriculum. Then in March 2020 COVID-19 forced us to move online. I designed and implemented our 
    online learning program. I trained teachers on the new technology needed to move our instrcution online. I trained students, parents, staff and teachers on the new tools and created instructional documents and videos
    to aid with the transition. The school remained online for the next year and a half. As we continued to study online I looked for ways to improve student engangement and learning outcomes. I introduced a kids coding program,
    where primary school students learned the fundamentals of coding using Scratch.
</p>
<p>
    From 2016 until 2021, I worked as an online English teacher for a Chinese company called VIPkid. I taught 1-to-1 courses to students in China, via
    the companies online learning platform. This was my first experience teaching and working remotely. It demonstrated to me the value the online learning can bring to students throughout the world.
</p>
<p> I started teaching English as a second language in 2013, when I moved to Cambodia. I taught English learners in both Cambodia and Thailand. I primarily taught primary age students but also taught business English
    to employees as Samsung Thailand and ITELS to secondary school students.
